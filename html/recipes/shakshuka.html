        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 diced onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed plum tomatoes </li>
        <li>1/2 cup water, or more as needed </li>
        <li>6 large eggs </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley </li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Directions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
             Add onions and mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt. Cook and stir until
              mushrooms release all of their liquid and start to brown, about 
              10 minutes. Stir in bell peppers and jalapeno pepper. Cook and 
              stir until peppers begin to soften up, about 5 minutes. Season 
              with cumin, paprika, turmeric, black pepper, and cayenne. Stir 
              and cook to "wake up" the flavors, about 1 minute. Pour in crushed
               tomatoes and water. Adjust heat to medium and simmer uncovered until
                veggies are softened and sweet, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes.
                 Add more water if sauce becomes too thick.</li>
        <li>Make a depression in the sauce for each egg with a large spoon. Crack egg 
            into a small ramekin and slide gently into each indentation; repeat with 
            the rest of the eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until 
            eggs are to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Top with feta cheese and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
