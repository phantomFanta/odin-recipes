        <p>Some time ago I had a lot of weird ideas in my head. For example
            I thought cooking isn't a cost effective thing, and one can do just
            fine eating something like fast food all the time. Oh foolish, lazy
            and clueless me from the past... He didn't know that cooking, in fact 
            doest have to be hard in order to produce tasty results. Besides cooking
            turned out to be a surprisingly enjoyable thing, and home-made meals are
            usually far healthier than some fast food. The three simple and delicious
            recipes below are the ones which led me to enlightment about cooking. Hope
            you will enjoy them!</p>
